<h5>Information Disclosure</h5>
<p>A&M Chess Camps will not sell any personally identifiable information to any third party, other than to partners as previously discussed. We may provide information about groups of registrants or aggregated information that does not contain personal information by individual, or we may provide information in such a way that identification of an individual from the data is not possible. This information may be used for marketing, promotional or other purposes.</p> 
<p>We may also be required to provide information in response to a government or law enforcement request, subpoena, or other legal process. While this is unlikely, we will provide only the specific information requested and only to the extent required or only as recommended by our legal counsel. We will not simply submit your information without first determining that we are legally required to do so in response to a legal requirement or to avoid a violation of the law. By accepting this policy, you give your consent to us to provide such information if in our sole discretion it is necessary for this purpose, to mitigate or reduce potential liability to us, or to protect or enforce rights we may have.</p>
<p>Information gathered by us may be used (but only in accordance with this policy) by related or companies under common control, or for use by potential acquirers or investors in evaluating an investment, merger, or acquisition of A&M Chess Camps or its affiliates. We will request those that have been provided this information that they abide by this policy.</p>
<p>While we will take measures to ensure the privacy of your information, transmission of data over the internet is vulnerable to inappropriate or illegal use. We can not ensure that your information will not be intercepted and used inappropriately, particularly before it arrives at our site and after it leaves our site.</p>
<p>We may make periodic changes to this policy. Some of these changes may be significant. If we decide that we should make a significant change to this policy we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and give you an opportunity to request removal of your information. A full refund minus a $25 service fee is given if cancellation request is received 30 days before the camp. After this, refunds will not be given. If a child is sick and is unable to attend the camp, a doctor’s note is required for a refund minus the service fee to be given. Switching sessions or camps is permitted based on space available. There will be a $25 change fee accessed for any change to camp session.</p>  
<h5>Use of Photographs</h5>
<p>From time to time A&M may take photographs of the students for purposes of providing individual and group photos to parents as part of the camp offering. Additionally, A&M may use photographs, videos, written extraction and voice recordings of camp  particiapnts for the purpose of illustrations and publications, including the A&M website. By registering for a camp, you consent to the use of these images, recordings, etc. for the above purposes.</p>
<h5>Refund Policy</h5>
<p>Chess camps are scheduled for an entire week or in some cases a defined two-week session. We must therefore commit an instructor based upon registrations. We can not, therefore prorate, or adjust the camp's fee for weeks missed by a student or refund the fee except in unusual circumstances. Refunds will be provided only at the discretion of A&M Chess Camps.</p>
<h5>Disciplinary Policy</h5>
<p>We do not anticipate any disciplinary problems during our camps, but we still must set standards. A Camp Code of Conduct is provided to each camper to set the standard. If a disciplinary problem arises within a camp, the camper will receive one warning and a phone call home to their parents. If a second disciplinary problem arises, that camper could be expelled from the camp without any financial credit. If a camper’s behavior becomes so severe or endangers other campers, immediate expulsion from camp without phone calls, warnings, or financial credit may be necessary.</p>
